Static Router

192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernete/2
- 192.168.1.0/24 matches 192.168.1.0 ~ 192.168.1.255.
- If R1 receives a packet with a destination in that range, it will
send the packet out of G0/2.


e.g. 

Case:
192.168.1.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks
192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernete/2
192.168.1.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernete/2

Question:
a Packet destined for 192.168.1.1 is matched by both routes:

use which one?
- it will choose the most specific matching route

- The route to 192.168.1.0/24 includes 256 different IP addresses (192.168.1.0 — 192.168.1.255)

The route to 192.168.1.1/32 includes only 1 IP address (192.168.1.1)
» This route is more specific.


> Local route = keep the packet, don't forward it

route if don't have the setting of that ip packet, it just drop it

Quiz 
The IP address configured on a router interface will appear in the routing table as what kind of
route?

a) Static
b) Connected
c) Local
d) Dynamic

ans: C ❌

# Static Router Lesson 2

defalt gateway => defalt router
gateway => through which Router

The default gateway configuration is also called a default route.
~It is a route to 0.0.0.0/0 = all netmask bits set to 0. Includes all addresses from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

The default route is the least specific route
possible, because it includes all IP addresses.
0.0.0.0/0 = 4,294,967,296 IP addresses

A/32 route (ie. Local route) is the most specific
route possible, because it specifies only one IP
address.
192.168.1.1/32 = 1 IP address


*to learn R1 G0/2's MAC address, PC1 will first send
an ARP request to 192.168.1.1.

- to send through another ip address
    - first send arp requst to router first
    - own router 
    - then decide which roadmap , which direction , which **next hopY**


It is possible to configure the routers to:
    - load-balance between path 1) and 2)
    - Use path 1) as the main path and path 2) as a backup path


R4(config)# ip route ip-address netmask next-hop

if ping -> work:
    two-way reachability.
    PC1 can reach PC4, and PC4 can reach PC1.


Other way ❌
exclusion way:

R2(config)# ip route ip-address netmask exit-interface
- specifies which router don't use or skip

ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 go/0
ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 g0/1 192.168.24.4

R2(config)# ip route ip-address netmask exit-interface
R2(config)# ip route ip-address netmask exit-interface next-hop

Static routes in which you specify only the exit-interface
rely on a feature called Proxy ARP to function.
This is usually not a problem, but generally you can stick to
next-hop or exit-interface next-hop.
Neither is ‘better’ than the other: use which you prefer.

# Default Route
A default route is a route to 0.0.0.0/0
- 0.0.0.0/0 is the least specific route possible; it includes every possible destination IP address.

- If the router doesn’t have any more specific routes that match a packet's destination IP address, thi
router will forward the packet using the default route.

- A default route is often used to direct traffic to the Internet.
- More specific routes are used for destinations in the internal corporate network.
- Traffic to destinations outside of the internal network is sent to the Internet.


when show => show ip route:
    Gateway of last resort is not set => No default route has been configured yet.

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
S* 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 203.0.113.2

Quiz ❌

Examine R1’s routing table. Which interface will it use to forward packets destined for 8.8.8.8?

0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 203.0.113.2
via 192.168.12.2
172 16 0 0/16 [1/0] via 192.168.13.3
192.168.12.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks
192.168.12.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1
192.168.12.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEtherneto/1

192.168.13.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks
192.168.13.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEtherneto/0
oalE), 1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/@
1 ri 2 b 2 _masks
283 0. 113 0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEtherneto/2
203.0.113.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet@/2

a) GigabitEthernet0/0

b) GigabitEthernet0/1

c) GigabitEthernet0/2

d) It will drop the packet.

ans : c , 
- because 0.0.0.0 => include all, inclue 8.8.8.8 for sure, and 203.0.113.2 => last 2 => G0/2

ans : d 
Becasue of S => static , can't be auto connected

# Troubleshooting lab

- ipconfig => check own ip and gateway (route)
    - ping destination
    - ping gateway

- show ip interface brief
    if all up , then it is fine
- show ip route
    
![1736972830-include-command.png](assets/1736972830-include-command.png)

- config terminal
-> type **no** 192 ... etc (copy that highlighted)
![1736972955-ip-route.png](assets/1736972955-ip-route.png)


> in config mode, you have to **do** the command 

no ip route -> 
ip route xx xx corrected one


- could be S gateway problem
- could be ip address problem
- could be ip interface g0/0 prolbem

config t
interface g0/0
ip add xxx 255.255.255
- replace the wrong ip automatically

do sh running config
do sh run
- to check the status

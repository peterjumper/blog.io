# It creates a temporary Table of Contents (TOC) file by extracting h1, h2, and h3 headers from the main HTML file.
# It inserts the TOC into the main HTML file just after the <body> tag.
# It adds id attributes to the headers in the main HTML file for internal linking.
# It uses Calibre's ebook-convert to convert the HTML file to EPUB format, specifying the TOC structure.
# Finally, it cleans up the temporary TOC file.

--embed-font-family

    Embed the specified font family into the book. This specifies the "base" font used for the book. If the input document specifies its own fonts, they may override this base font. You can use the filter style information option to remove fonts from the input document. Note that font embedding only works with some output formats, principally EPUB, AZW3 and DOCX.

--embed-all-fonts

        Embed every font that is referenced in the input document but not already embedded. This will search your system for the fonts, and if found, they will be embedded. Embedding will only work if the format you are converting to supports embedded fonts, such as EPUB, AZW3, DOCX or PDF. Please ensure that you have the proper license for embedding the fonts used in this document.

# 7z and epub

To update the EPUB file using 7-Zip, you can use the following command line:

```bash
7z u sicp.epub mimetype html META-INF content.opf index.xhtml LICENSE toc.xhtml
```

This command will update the `sicp.epub` file with the listed files and directories[1][5]. Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `7z`: Invokes the 7-Zip command-line tool
- `u`: Update command, which adds new files and updates existing ones in the archive
- `sicp.epub`: The name of your EPUB file
- The remaining items are the files and directories to be updated or added

Note that the `mimetype` file should be the first file in the EPUB archive and should not be compressed[2]. To ensure this, you may want to use a two-step process:

1. Add the mimetype file without compression:

```bash
7z a -tzip sicp.epub mimetype -mx0
```

2. Then add or update the remaining files:

```bash
7z u sicp.epub html META-INF content.opf index.xhtml LICENSE toc.xhtml
```

This approach ensures that the `mimetype` file is the first in the archive and uncompressed, which is important for EPUB validation[2][7].

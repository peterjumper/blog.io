3.  **Cross-Testing Memory (If multiple sticks are present):**
    - If you have two or more memory modules, test them by swapping their slots.
    - Steps:
      1.  Turn off the computer and unplug the power cable.
      2.  Remove one memory stick.
      3.  Power on the computer and check if the system operates normally. Verify if blue screens or crashes continue.
      4.  If problems persist, test the other memory stick or alternate between them to identify the faulty module.
4.  **If Only One Memory Stick:**
    - Clean the gold fingers or try inserting it into a different memory slot.

**Memory Stick Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  Power off and open the chassis.
    - Disconnect the power and remove the side panel or glass cover.
2.  Remove the memory stick, gently clean it with an eraser or towel.
3.  Reinsert the memory stick and power on the system to check if it resolves the issue.

if old mechine ,

- it could be legacy driver issue.

[How to install Legacy Driver on Windows 10 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyL9jGhuuX8&ab_channel=IgoroTech)

## no display

- check power, elecitity
- **search for the cx got internal graphical card, make sure cx are using gpu dp port rather than internal vga (blue) port for displaying**
- if it is new mechine, there is highly that the mechine is fine
- seldom case: bios didn't enable the port
- sometime, company provide hdmi to dp port , or hdmi to hdmi with dp adapter etc

Case 2 , if the pc got internal gpu card ,
extract the gpu card (external) and use internal card to determine weather it is the problem of our graphic card

- if the monitor is ok, it is mostly likely 90% the issue of gpu card, L4 gpu to cx

## Black screen

- date of time ..., date of datem, -> cmos battery running out of battery
- no ram, -> error message when booting the pc
- hard disk? -> bios detect the hard disk or not
- fans -> rear fans is actually in the front fans

## USB

- suggest client use another port first
- some product (can't detect the usb port, built in motherboard -> L2,
- newest product like 6 version usually port connected to motherboard , can't seperately fix it
- if using for a while , just demaged in the front usb port rather than in motherboard -> only the front usb port

## Graphical card

- if the pc got the graphical card while also having the internal vidow card -> vga wont' work -> no display

### **1/CPU Fault:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - No display on boot, screen flickering, system crashes, blue screen.
  - System keeps restarting automatically.
  - Alarm sounds.
  - Program crashes.
  - Frequent crashes.
  - Overheating.

### **CPU Fault Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Hardware Testing:**

    - Since the motherboard and CPU cannot be cross-tested, prioritize troubleshooting other hardware issues first.

2.  **Check the Cooling System:**

    - Regularly clean the dust from the heat sink and ensure the CPU fan is working properly.

---

### **2/ Motherboard Fault:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - Computer won't power on.
  - System instability.
  - Hardware devices not recognized.
  - Boot-up self-test error messages.
  - Flashing indicator lights on the motherboard.
  - Suspected physical damage to the motherboard.
  - CMOS battery replacement doesn’t resolve the issue (system still loses information).
  - Problems persist even after replacing memory or graphics card.
  - Missing drivers.
  - Beep codes on startup (e.g., HP: one long and one short beep, Lenovo: rapid beeping, Dell: no sound, AIO: no sound).

### **Motherboard Fault Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Hardware Testing:**

    - Since the motherboard and CPU cannot be cross-tested, prioritize troubleshooting other hardware issues first.

2.  **Cleaning Method:**

    - Use compressed air or a hairdryer with cool air (avoid using a brush) to gently blow dust off the motherboard.
    - Reconnect and reseat any motherboard connections.

3.  **Visual Inspection:**

    - Carefully examine the motherboard for any burnt, deformed, or detached components, or any areas showing abnormal discoloration.

### **3/Memory Fault:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - The computer powers on (lights and fans are working), but there is no display / black screen.
  - Any electronic component can potentially cause boot failure due to issues such as poor contact.
  - Artifacts on the screen (irregular / random patterns).
  - System crashes, blue screen.
  - Boot loops (repeated restarts), applicable to new machines (AIO and gaming PCs).
  - System instability, poor compatibility, system errors (e.g., error messages from specific software or overall system lag).

### **Memory Fault Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Reseat the Memory Module:**
    - Remove and reinsert the memory stick (ensure it does not touch the contacts directly).
2.  **Gold Finger Oxidation:**
    - **Cleaning:** Use an eraser, alcohol, and a dry towel to gently clean the gold fingers (the contact points on the memory module).
3.  **Cross-Testing Memory (If multiple sticks are present):**
    - If you have two or more memory modules, test them by swapping their slots.
    - Steps:
      1.  Turn off the computer and unplug the power cable.
      2.  Remove one memory stick.
      3.  Power on the computer and check if the system operates normally. Verify if blue screens or crashes continue.
      4.  If problems persist, test the other memory stick or alternate between them to identify the faulty module.
4.  **If Only One Memory Stick:**
    - Clean the gold fingers or try inserting it into a different memory slot.

**Memory Stick Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  Power off and open the chassis.
    - Disconnect the power and remove the side panel or glass cover.
2.  Remove the memory stick, gently clean it with an eraser or towel.
3.  Reinsert the memory stick and power on the system to check if it resolves the issue.
4.  If the issue persists, swap slots or try a different stick.

### **4/ Graphics Card Fault:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - Artifacts on the screen (regular patterns).
  - Flickering screen.
  - No display on boot.
  - No response on boot (electronic short circuit).
  - Error with the graphics card on startup.

### **Graphics Card Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Clean the Gold Fingers:**
    - Power off the computer, open the chassis, and remove the graphics card.
    - Clean the gold fingers with an eraser or dry cloth.
    - Reinstall the card and secure it in place.
2.  **Reconnect and Test:**
    - Power on the system and check if the issue persists.

### **5/ Hard Drive Fault:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - System crashes, blue screen.
  - Unable to boot into the system (YouTube videos not working).
  - Boot errors indicating hardware problems (e.g., issues with fans or graphics card).
  - No system detected (e.g., no boot found, often due to missing hard drive).
  - System freezes at BIOS, keyboard unresponsive.
  - Slow read/write speeds or abnormal sounds (common in refurbished machines or mechanical hard drives).

### **Hard Drive Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Check Hardware Connections:**

    - Ensure the hard drive is correctly connected to the computer, including data and power cables. For external drives, try changing USB ports or cables.

2.  **Restart the Computer:**

    - A simple restart can sometimes resolve temporary hardware or software conflicts.

3.  **Software Troubleshooting:**

    - Ensure the operating system is running properly and update drivers as needed.
    - Use Disk Management in Windows to check the hard drive status and perform necessary actions.

4.  **Disk Management Tool:**

    - Use Windows Disk Management (WIN+X) to check the drive’s status, and if necessary, partition or format the drive.

### **6/ Power Supply Fault:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - Computer does not power on.
  - Unstable restarts or shutdowns.
  - No response on boot.

### **Power Supply Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Check Power Cable Connection:**

    - Make sure the power cable is securely plugged in and check for damage or poor connection.

2.  **Power Indicator Lights:**

    - Verify if the power indicator light on the front of the chassis is on to confirm power supply is working.

3.  **Check Power Switch Setting:**

    - Ensure the power switch is set to the correct position (for 110v or 220v).

4.  **Voltage Check:**

    - If the voltage is not set correctly, it can cause issues like:
      - Device failing to start or shutting down immediately.
      - Unstable operation or crashes.
      - Slow system performance or program crashes.
      - Risk of electrical hazards (burning, explosions).

2.  **Test Display Settings:**

    - After turning on the system, adjust the resolution and display settings via the system settings to default values.

3.  **Cross-Test the Monitor:**

    - Disconnect the monitor, restart it, and check if it runs its self-test.
    - Update or reinstall the graphics card drivers if necessary.

### **8/ CMOS Battery Fault:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - No response on boot (due to overvoltage protection).
  - Automatic boot on power connection without pressing the power button.
  - System time resets when the power is unplugged.

### **CMOS Battery Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Check CMOS Battery Status:**
    - Disconnect the power, wait for 10-30 seconds, then reconnect. If the system time resets or the machine powers on automatically, the CMOS battery may need replacing.

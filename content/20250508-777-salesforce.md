Schema Builder can make you directly adding attribute into the object(customized object)

- gui, mindmap
- view object manager right click as well (feature)

- but you still to make it manually make it visible for user , by drag and drop , kind of like make \_\_object to

- there is another visible setting require to make (field setting) , user + field visible -> really visible in profile

- use Fields & Relationships to check the basic unit / attribute for understanding

using gpt to suggesting which field do we need to create

e.g. Fields: Warranty Name, Description, Warranty Provider, Start Date, End Date, Warranty Status, Asset.

Q:For the Warranty Management Object, tell me more about the Warranty Provider field. Could that Warranty Provider field be related to the Account object? If so, should I make that a Lookup Relationship or a Master-Detail Relationship?

master-detail relationship -> mean that child object need their parent object created first

Q:For the Warranty Status field, should that be a picklist field? And if so, what are 4 or 5 good example status designations that | should include as options?

- in sales force you cant' create master detail relationship field if you have alread created records(like contact,(phone,
  address , email)), you need to created look up and then flip it to be master detail relationship

  - not adding related list in this case

- in view mode , selet new created field , pick existed contact and apply to all view list unit

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-21-48.png)

once you apply to previous data, now you can flip it to master detail relationship

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-23-01.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-23-23.png)

- enable re-parenting, (like change the contact)

now adding to it to page layout(front end) by using Lightning App Builder -> details -> contact layout -> it will jump
to object manager page layout

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-28-17.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-28-35.png)

- adding more features on that (more info)

- adding to not only contact page , but also account page (repeated adding frontend like notion page)

# Junction objects

- allow you create many many relationship

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-32-43.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-34-25.png)
Q: apply to our case , what can be ^^ in our case:
mulitiple contact that responsible for different roles -> junction objects

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-39-30.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-41-32.png)

it created from backend and make it visable in the graph

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-42-57.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-43-53.png)
bulking add roles from gpt in setup ->object manager

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-44-51.png)

- and change the data type from text to auto number
  - so there isn't text need to be input , but auto number instead

the usage :

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-47-42.png)

more detail can be picked as junction objects did that

---

when deleting the field, affecting:

- page layout

make sure to do data export , backup first, better checked in mindmap as well

# record types

- objects are nouns, record types is adj

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-54-21.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-55-07.png)

- it will increased add a level or layer of complexity.

vendor, clinet , provider etc

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-56-21.png)

- you can created different page layout for different type of record types

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-58-24.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-58-33.png)

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-04-58-51.png)

mind map for complex cases

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-05-05-51.png)
now he change the correct name, so previous setup is easy for he locating which page

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-08-05-06-42.png)

Topic - (dash) what opportunity of the name

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-09-04-40-06.png)

- account + contact + opportunity

- some the data might loss during the conversion process

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-09-04-42-06.png)
because some field in lead is customemized field for oppurtunity(other departement)

- aka custom to custom field mapping

backend ->

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-09-04-43-47.png)
if none fields , then created one

so as contact, account

- you also need to think which field from lead page should be mapping to contact? or other

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-09-04-48-14.png)

seacch the unique field first -> think -> make customerize field for according department

hidden css type -> go the website once submited web-lead -form

![](20250508-777-salesforce/2025-05-09-04-56-36.png)

hidden input for lead_source to value Web (the one setting you have done on leads page)

- so its will recevie new form with a correct web (source of lead)

- asking gpt to use bootstrap (css tools lol)

- use replit to test it

gpt actually can give email validation feature

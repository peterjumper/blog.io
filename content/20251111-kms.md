# Turn webpages into epub

```bash
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

# Point this at whatever file your URLs are stored in.
urls="urls"

# Make the directory where we'll store the clean HTML for each post.
mkdir -p posts

# Iterate over the URLs, download them and clean them up with the readability-cli
# We use a count here to ensure that we organize the output posts in the same order that they are specified
# in the input file. This is helpful as you can lay out the full order of your book by just editing the URLs file.
count=1
cat "$urls" | while read url
do
    output=$(printf "posts/%03d.html" $count)
    readable -q --low-confidence force "$url" -o "$output" 2>&1 > /dev/null

done

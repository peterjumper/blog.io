back [[1736130293-ccna-notes]]

- Switcher -> expand network
    - could be in the same network
    1 lan 1 network , 2 switch

## Network Layer (Layer 3)
- Router operate at layer 3

add one router in the middle
- become two network

192.168.1.0/24
192.168.1 -> ip address

.0 -> represent end host

/24 -> represent the first three part is the ip address

24/8 = 3 , first 3 part 
1 dot mean 8 

IP address are 32bits (4 bytes) in length


now  learning how to convert ip to binary

----
> Quick Review

    C represents 12
    D represents 13
    E represents 14
To convert CDE to decimal, we calculate: C * 16² + D * 16¹ + E * 16⁰

ip 192 first part:

192. -> binary
- called octet binary


11000000
right to left first
2^0 + 2^1 + ... 
🦧
1x2 + 2x2 +3x2 ...
> two different method to write that down


128+64=192

> so how to convert decimal to binary?
- by attraction 
192 -168 => if can, 1 

255 => sum(all 8 bits) 

- so ip address-> 32 bits 
**"/24" -> first three part 1 part per 8 bits**, and the last part represent end host

- ip (first three part are the same) -> same network

Class | First octet | numerial range | prefix
A 0xxxxxxx 0-127 /8
B 10xxxxxx 128-191 /16
C 110xxxxx 192-223 /24
D 1110xxxx 224-239 
E 1111xxxx 240-255

Address range 127.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 
- loopback address
    - Used to test the ‘network stack’ (think OSI, TCP/IP model) on the  local device

Class A: 12.128.251.23/8 -> **check the first octet numerial range** , largest no. of host
Class B: 154.78.111.32/16 -> class B , medium
Class C: 192 .168.1.254 /24 class C -> fewer host, 

---
# netmask (right hand side is cisco way )
Class A: /8 255.0.0.0

Class B: /16

Class C: /24

> - **Host portion of the address is all O's = Network Address**

 - **The network address CANNOT be assigned to a host.**

- last available address can't be 255 as well , last should be 254

last value => 255 could be represent broadcasting ,  

last value 0 => host network address AND 255 => broadcasting 

0 AND 255 can't be assigned to address

# Class A usable range is not 0-127 but 1-126

- size of rest bit field
-> 32 - size of the ip network, e.g. class A 32 -8 = 24

2^24 => 16777216 address per network

e.g. 192.168.1.0/24 

- max host per network 
-> 192.168.1.255/24

only 1 part left => 2^8 => 256,(1 part = 8 bit)

2^8 - 2(exclud the 0 and 255) => 254 total final ans

172.16.0.0/16 => 172.16.255.255/16 

2^16 = 65536 - 2 = 65534

- still - 2 only because the speicial case require all 0 and all 255


> Maximum hosts per network = 2^n-2
(n = number of host bits , = parts * 8)

add one to the last part of bit = first usable address

last usable address would be minus one

# IPv4 address (command line)

- Status (e.g. Dminitratively down ) => layer 1 status

- Protocol => Layer 2 status

en => enable advanced mode

conf t => enter configuation commands , global

interface gigabitethernet 0/0

short cut:

int tab 

g0/0 => replace : gigabitethernet 0/0

10.255.255.254 ? => 255 = subnet mask

ip address 10.255.255.254 255.0.0.0 (represent =/8)

**no shutdown** => enable it 

do so ip int br => show ip interface brie

My insight:
- interface => usually mean the last usable address

---

cisco command:

show interfaces [interface]

show interfaces descriptions => show up or down

int g0/0
description ## manaal setting the desc ##
int g/0/1
descriptino ## this is 1 ##

Quiz :
PC1 has an IP address of 43.109.23.12/3
Find the following:

Network address: 43.0.0.0

Maximum number of hosts in the network: 16,777,214
Network broadcast address: 43.255.255.255

First usable address of the network: 43.0.0.1

Last usable address of the network: 43.255.255.254

---

cisco command:

en 
conf t

host 

hostname R1 (change the hostname)

do sh ip inter br
- do before this so that it can run in global mode

int g???
ip add xxx.xxx.xx xx.255.255.255
no stutdown

show running config

---
save config

e.g. copy run
e.g write memory

short cut => wr

configuring ip : 
click and change their  config by gui into their own ipaddress

click on pc1 and start command line tool => ping other pc

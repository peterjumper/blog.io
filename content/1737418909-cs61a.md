- Functions are first-class, meaning they can be manipulated as values

# A higher-order function is:

1. A function that a function as an argument
   and/or
2. A function that returns a function as a return value

# Describing funtions

- function's domain
  - all inputs that might be as arguments
- function's range
  - set of output values it might possibly return
- function's behavior
  - relationship that creates btw input and output

Don’t repeat yourself (DRY). Implement a process just once, but execute it many times.

e.g round (1.23,1), ronud(1.23)

Great question! The reason why `term(k)` is equal to the `identity` function (i.e., why calling `term(k)` effectively means calling `identity(k)`) lies in how functions are passed as arguments in Python.

---

### **1. Function as an Argument (Function Reference)**

When you call:

```python
summation(n, identity)
```

You are passing the `identity` function itself as an argument to the `summation` function. Notice that you're passing **the function reference**, **not** calling it with parentheses (`identity()`).

**Key point:**

- `identity` (without parentheses) is a reference to the function.
- `identity(x)` (with parentheses) would immediately execute the function.

So when `summation` is defined as:

```python
def summation(n, term):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + term(k), k + 1  # calling term with k
    return total
```

Here, `term` acts as a placeholder for any function passed to `summation`. If you pass `identity`, then inside the loop:

```python
total, k = total + term(k), k + 1
```

Becomes:

```python
total, k = total + identity(k), k + 1
```

Thus, `term(k)` effectively translates to `identity(k)` when `identity` is passed as an argument.

---

### **2. Why Not Call `identity(k)` Directly?**

If you had written `summation(n, identity(k))`, this would cause an error or unintended behavior because:

- `identity(k)` would be executed immediately **before** being passed to `summation`.
- Instead of passing the function, you'd be passing the **result** of `identity(k)` when `summation` starts, which is not the intended behavior.

---

### **3. Example to Clarify the Concept**

Consider this example:

```python
def example(func):
    return func(5)  # Calling the function with 5

def double(x):
    return x * 2

print(example(double))  # Pass function reference, outputs 10
```

- Here, `example(double)` passes the function `double` without executing it.
- Inside `example`, we call `func(5)`, which results in `double(5)`.

---

### **4. Visualizing the Execution of `sum_naturals(10)`**

When you call:

```python
sum_naturals(10)
```

It expands like this:

```python
summation(10, identity)
```

- Inside `summation`, the function `identity` is assigned to the parameter `term`.
- Then `term(k)` calls `identity(k)`, meaning it just returns `k` as is.

---

### **5. Another Example for Better Understanding**

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def caller(func, value):
    return func(value)

print(caller(greet, "Alice"))  # Output: "Hello, Alice!"
```

Here:

- `caller(greet, "Alice")` means that `func = greet`, so `func(value)` → `greet("Alice")`.

---

# Let's break down the key concepts from this section on **nested function definitions, lexical scoping, and environment models**, step by step.

---

## **1. Why Use Nested Functions?**

In the previous example, functions like `golden_update` and `square_close_to_successor` were defined globally. However, this leads to two main problems:

1. **Name Clutter:**

   - Many small functions pollute the global namespace.
   - All function names must be unique, which can make naming difficult.

2. **Argument Restrictions:**
   - Some functions, like `sqrt_update`, require multiple parameters, but the `improve` function expects an update function that takes only one argument.

### **Solution: Nested Functions**

Nested function definitions solve both of these problems by allowing functions to be defined **inside** another function. This way, helper functions remain hidden (local), reducing global clutter and providing flexibility in managing arguments.

---

## **2. Example: Computing the Square Root Using Nested Functions**

Here's an example of using nested functions to compute the square root of a number:

```python
def average(x, y):
    return (x + y) / 2

def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-3):
    return abs(x - y) < tolerance

def sqrt(a):
    def sqrt_update(x):
        return average(x, a / x)  # Nested function uses 'a' from sqrt's scope

    def sqrt_close(x):
        return approx_eq(x * x, a)  # Another nested function

    return improve(sqrt_update, sqrt_close)
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of Execution**

When you call `sqrt(256)`, the following happens:

1. **Local frame creation:**

   - A new local frame for `sqrt` is created with `a = 256`.

2. **Nested function definitions:**

   - `sqrt_update` and `sqrt_close` are defined **inside** the `sqrt` function.
   - They have access to the `a` parameter from `sqrt` due to **lexical scoping**.

3. **Calling `improve`:**
   - `improve` is called with these nested functions, iteratively improving the guess until convergence.

---

### **3. Key Concept: Lexical Scoping**

Lexical scoping means that **nested functions have access to variables defined in the enclosing function's scope**.

#### **Example:**

In the `sqrt` function:

```python
def sqrt(a):
    def sqrt_update(x):
        return average(x, a / x)  # 'a' comes from the outer function 'sqrt'

    def sqrt_close(x):
        return approx_eq(x * x, a)

    return improve(sqrt_update, sqrt_close)
```

Here, both `sqrt_update` and `sqrt_close` can directly access `a`, even though `a` is not passed to them explicitly. This works because Python resolves variables using the **enclosing scope**.

---

### **4. Environment Model with Nested Functions**

To understand how Python handles nested functions, consider the environment model:

1. **Before calling `sqrt(256)`:**

   - The `sqrt` function exists in the **global environment**.

2. **When `sqrt(256)` is called:**

   - A **new local frame** for `sqrt` is created with `a = 256`.
   - The local environment is established where `sqrt_update` and `sqrt_close` are defined.

3. **Calling `improve`:**
   - `improve` is invoked with the nested functions.
   - When `sqrt_update` is called inside `improve`, it looks for `a` in its **parent environment**, which is the local environment of `sqrt`.

---

### **5. Scope Lookup Order (LEGB Rule)**

Python follows the **LEGB rule** when resolving variable names:

1. **Local (L):** Variables inside the function.
2. **Enclosing (E):** Variables from outer (enclosing) functions.
3. **Global (G):** Variables defined at the top level of the module.
4. **Built-in (B):** Variables from built-in Python functions.

Thus, in our example:

- `a` is not found in `sqrt_update`'s local scope.
- It checks the enclosing function `sqrt` and finds `a` there.
- If not found in `sqrt`, it would check the global scope.

---

### **6. Advantages of Nested Functions**

Using nested functions provides several benefits:

1. **Encapsulation:**

   - Helper functions (`sqrt_update` and `sqrt_close`) are not exposed globally.
   - They are only accessible within `sqrt`, reducing potential conflicts.

2. **Cleaner Code:**

   - Keeps related logic together within the function.
   - Easier to understand and modify.

3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Arguments:**
   - Nested functions can access outer function variables without passing them explicitly.

---

### **7. Practical Example: Using Nested Functions in Other Scenarios**

#### **Example: Factorial Calculation**

```python
def factorial(n):
    def fact_helper(acc, k):
        if k > n:
            return acc
        return fact_helper(acc * k, k + 1)
    return fact_helper(1, 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

#### **Example: Finding the Fixed Point of a Function**

```python
def fixed_point(f, guess=1):
    def close_enough(x):
        return approx_eq(f(x), x)

    def update(x):
        return f(x)

    return improve(update, close_enough)

print(fixed_point(lambda x: 1 + 1/x))  # Approximates the golden ratio
```

---

### **8. Comparison of Nested vs. Global Functions**

| Aspect            | Global Functions    | Nested Functions                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Scope             | Available globally  | Available only in enclosing function |
| Encapsulation     | No                  | Yes                                  |
| Argument Passing  | Required explicitly | Not required                         |
| Code Organization | Spread out          | More localized                       |

---

### **9. Summary**

1. **Nested functions** allow defining helper functions inside another function to avoid clutter and simplify parameter management.
2. **Lexical scoping** enables inner functions to access variables from their enclosing functions.
3. The **environment model** helps track where functions are defined and how they access variables.
4. Nested functions improve **encapsulation, readability, and flexibility**.

# Let's break down the concept of **functions as returned values** and the example of function composition step by step.

---

## **1. Functions Returning Functions**

In Python (and many other languages), functions can return other functions as values. This means that a function can dynamically create and return a new function during execution.

### **Why is this useful?**

- It allows for **higher-order programming**, meaning we can create generic, reusable components.
- It enables **function composition**, closures, and more expressive abstractions.
- Functions can remember values from their defining environment, making them powerful for building customized behaviors.

---

## **2. Example: Function Composition**

Function composition is a technique where one function's output becomes another function's input.

Mathematically, given:

\[
h(x) = f(g(x))
\]

We want to create a function `compose1` that takes two functions `f` and `g` and returns a new function `h` that applies `g` first, then `f` to the result.

### **Python Code:**

```python
def compose1(f, g):
    def h(x):
        return f(g(x))
    return h
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. `compose1` takes two functions, `f` and `g`, as arguments.
2. Inside `compose1`, a new function `h(x)` is defined:
   - It first applies `g(x)`, then passes the result to `f`.
3. Finally, `h` is **returned**, allowing us to call the composition later.

---

### **3. How It Works in Practice**

Let's try composing two simple functions:

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

# Create a new composed function
composed_function = compose1(square, increment)

print(composed_function(3))  # Output: square(increment(3)) = square(4) = 16
```

### **What happens internally:**

1. `compose1(square, increment)` returns a new function `h(x)` that does `square(increment(x))`.
2. When we call `composed_function(3)`, it executes as follows:

   - `increment(3)` → returns `4`
   - `square(4)` → returns `16`
   - Final result: `16`

---

## **4. Lexical Scoping in Returned Functions**

A critical concept here is **lexical scoping**, meaning:

- When `h(x)` is returned from `compose1`, it retains access to the variables `f` and `g` even though `compose1` has finished executing.
- This works because Python stores the **parent environment** of `h` when it is defined.

### **Example of Scoping:**

```python
def outer_function():
    x = 10
    def inner_function():
        return x + 5
    return inner_function

f = outer_function()  # f is now a function that remembers x = 10
print(f())  # Output: 15
```

Even though `outer_function` has finished execution, `f()` still knows `x = 10` because of lexical scoping.

---

## **5. Environment Model Explanation**

Let's consider how Python manages the environment when `compose1` is executed.

1. **When `compose1` is called:**

   - A new local frame is created with parameters `f` and `g`.
   - The nested function `h` is defined inside this frame and remembers `f` and `g`.

2. **When `compose1` returns `h`:**

   - The function `h` is returned and stored in a variable.
   - It carries a reference to the enclosing environment where `f` and `g` were defined.

3. **When `h(x)` is called:**
   - It uses the stored references to apply `f(g(x))` correctly.

---

## **6. Practical Uses of Returning Functions**

Returning functions is a powerful concept used in many programming patterns:

1. **Customizable Function Behavior (Closures):**

   - Creating specialized versions of a function with preset values.

   ```python
   def multiplier(factor):
       def multiply(x):
           return x * factor
       return multiply

   double = multiplier(2)
   triple = multiplier(3)

   print(double(5))  # Output: 10
   print(triple(5))  # Output: 15
   ```

2. **Function Decorators:**

   - Wrapping functions to modify behavior without changing their code.

   ```python
   def logger(func):
       def wrapper(x):
           print(f"Calling function {func.__name__} with argument {x}")
           return func(x)
       return wrapper

   @logger
   def square(x):
       return x * x

   print(square(4))  # Logs the function call and returns 16
   ```

3. **Currying:**

   - Breaking down multi-argument functions into a series of single-argument functions.

   ```python
   def curry_add(a):
       def add_b(b):
           return a + b
       return add_b

   add_5 = curry_add(5)
   print(add_5(10))  # Output: 15
   ```

---

## **7. Summary**

- **Functions can return other functions,** allowing dynamic function creation and reuse.
- **Lexical scoping** ensures that returned functions "remember" variables from their defining environment.
- **Function composition** enables chaining of functions to build more complex operations.
- This concept is used in **closures, decorators, and functional programming techniques.**

- start thinking from the bottom , the first number that can % as 0 are the answer

Let’s break down the `cycle` function in Python as simply as possible. This is a higher-order function (a function that returns another function), and it’s all about applying three given functions (`f1`, `f2`, `f3`) in a repeating pattern based on a number `n`. I’ll explain it step-by-step, using examples from the docstring, and keep it beginner-friendly.

---

### What Does `cycle` Do?

- **Input**: Three functions (`f1`, `f2`, `f3`)—like `add1`, `times2`, `add3` in the example.
- **Output**: A function `g` that takes a number `n` and returns another function `h`.
- **What `h` Does**: Applies `f1`, `f2`, `f3` in a cycle (repeating every 3 steps) `n` times to a value `x`.

Think of it as a conveyor belt: you give it a number `n` (how many steps to run) and a starting value `x`, and it applies the functions in order—`f1`, `f2`, `f3`, then back to `f1`, and so on—`n` times.

---

### The Example Functions

These are the tools `cycle` uses:

- `add1(x)`: Adds 1 to `x` (e.g., `add1(5) = 6`).
- `times2(x)`: Doubles `x` (e.g., `times2(5) = 10`).
- `add3(x)`: Adds 3 to `x` (e.g., `add3(5) = 8`).

`my_cycle = cycle(add1, times2, add3)` sets up a pattern: `add1 → times2 → add3`, repeating.

---

### How It Works (Iterative Version)

The main code uses a loop to apply the functions. Let’s follow it:

- cycle makes a function that applies f1, f2, f3 in a loop, n times.

```python
def cycle(f1, f2, f3):
    def g(n):           # Takes number of steps
        def h(x):       # Takes the starting value this (x) is the same (x) from other formula, so when u can the fuction second time, it will be inputing x into each fuction
            i = 0       # Counter for steps
            while i < n:  # Run n times
                if i % 3 == 0:  # Step 0, 3, 6, ...: use f1
                    x = f1(x)
                elif i % 3 == 1:  # Step 1, 4, 7, ...: use f2
                    x = f2(x)
                else:            # Step 2, 5, 8, ...: use f3
                    x = f3(x)
                i += 1      # Next step
            return x       # Final result
        return h
    return g
```

- **`i % 3`**: This modulo trick cycles through `0, 1, 2` (then repeats), picking `f1`, `f2`, `f3`.
- Each step transforms `x`, and it stops after `n` steps.

---

### Examples from the Docstring

Let’s trace some examples to see it in action with `my_cycle = cycle(add1, times2, add3)`.

#### `identity = my_cycle(0)`

- `n = 0`: Loop runs 0 times (`i < 0` is false).
- `identity(5)`: Returns `5` unchanged.
- **Result**: `5`.

#### `add_one_then_double = my_cycle(2)`

- `n = 2`: Loop runs 2 times (`i = 0, 1`).
- Start with `x = 1`:
  - `i = 0`: `0 % 3 = 0`, `f1 = add1`, `x = add1(1) = 2`.
  - `i = 1`: `1 % 3 = 1`, `f2 = times2`, `x = times2(2) = 4`.
- **Result**: `4`.

#### `do_all_functions = my_cycle(3)`

- `n = 3`: Loop runs 3 times (`i = 0, 1, 2`).
- Start with `x = 2`:
  - `i = 0`: `f1 = add1`, `x = add1(2) = 3`.
  - `i = 1`: `f2 = times2`, `x = times2(3) = 6`.
  - `i = 2`: `f3 = add3`, `x = add3(6) = 9`.
- **Result**: `9`.

#### `do_more_than_a_cycle = my_cycle(4)`

- `n = 4`: Loop runs 4 times (`i = 0, 1, 2, 3`).
- Start with `x = 2`:
  - `i = 0`: `f1 = add1`, `x = add1(2) = 3`.
  - `i = 1`: `f2 = times2`, `x = times2(3) = 6`.
  - `i = 2`: `f3 = add3`, `x = add3(6) = 9`.
  - `i = 3`: `3 % 3 = 0`, `f1 = add1`, `x = add1(9) = 10`.
- **Result**: `10`.

#### `do_two_cycles = my_cycle(6)`

- `n = 6`: Loop runs 6 times (`i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`).
- Start with `x = 1`:
  - `i = 0`: `f1 = add1`, `x = 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - `i = 1`: `f2 = times2`, `x = 2 * 2 = 4`.
  - `i = 2`: `f3 = add3`, `x = 4 + 3 = 7`.
  - `i = 3`: `f1 = add1`, `x = 7 + 1 = 8`.
  - `i = 4`: `f2 = times2`, `x = 8 * 2 = 16`.
  - `i = 5`: `f3 = add3`, `x = 16 + 3 = 19`.
- **Result**: `19`.

---

### The Recursive Version (Alternative)

There’s also a recursive solution:

```python
def g(n):
    def h(x):
        if n == 0:
            return x  # No steps, return x
        return cycle(f2, f3, f1)(n - 1)(f1(x))  # Shift cycle, apply f1
    return h
```

- **Base Case**: `n = 0`, return `x` unchanged.
- **Recursive Step**: Apply `f1` to `x`, then pass the result to a new `cycle` with `f2, f3, f1` and `n-1`.
- It shifts the cycle: `f1 → f2 → f3` becomes `f2 → f3 → f1`, applying `f1` first.

For `my_cycle(2)(1)`:

- `n = 2`: `h(1) = cycle(times2, add3, add1)(1)(add1(1))`.
- `add1(1) = 2`.
- `n = 1`: `h(2) = cycle(add3, add1, times2)(0)(times2(2))`.
- `times2(2) = 4`.
- `n = 0`: `h(4) = 4`.
- **Result**: `4`.

---

### Simple Takeaway

- `cycle` makes a function that applies `f1, f2, f3` in a loop, `n` times.
- The pattern repeats every 3 steps: `add1, times2, add3, add1, ...`.
- `n` controls how many functions you apply, and `x` is the number you start with.

It’s like a dance: `n` steps, 3 moves, cycling through. Try it with small `n` values to see the pattern!

why starting point of x is different :

It seems like there’s a bit of confusion in your question—perhaps you’re asking why the starting value of `x` changes (like `x = 1` or `x = 2`) in the examples for the `cycle` function, and how that affects the outcome. I’ll assume you’re referring to the examples in the `cycle` docstring, where the input to the inner function `h(x)` varies (e.g., `identity(5)`, `add_one_then_double(1)`, `do_all_functions(2)`, etc.). Let’s clear this up simply and step-by-step!

### Why Does `x` Start Differently?

In the `cycle` function, `x` is the input you give to the inner function `h` when you call it—like `identity(5)` or `add_one_then_double(1)`. The starting value of `x` isn’t fixed by the `cycle` function itself; it’s whatever you choose to pass in when you use the function. The examples use different `x` values (`5`, `1`, `2`, etc.) to show how the same `cycle` logic behaves with different inputs.

- **Key Point**: The `cycle` function doesn’t “start” `x` at `1` or `2`. You, the user, decide what `x` is when you call the returned function (e.g., `my_cycle(2)(1)` means `x = 1`).

Let’s look at the examples to see why `x` varies and how it affects the result.

---

### Breaking Down the Examples

The `cycle` function is defined as `my_cycle = cycle(add1, times2, add3)`, where:

- `add1(x)`: `x + 1`
- `times2(x)`: `x * 2`
- `add3(x)`: `x + 3`

It applies these functions in a cycle (`add1 → times2 → add3`, repeating) `n` times to a starting value `x`. The docstring tests different `n` and `x` combinations.

#### Example 1: `identity(5)`

- Code: `identity = my_cycle(0); identity(5)`
- `n = 0`: No functions are applied (loop runs 0 times).
- `x = 5`: You pass `5` as the input.
- Result: `5` (unchanged because `n = 0`).
- **Why `x = 5`?**: The example chose `5` to show that with `n = 0`, any input stays the same.

#### Example 2: `add_one_then_double(1)`

- Code: `add_one_then_double = my_cycle(2); add_one_then_double(1)`
- `n = 2`: Apply 2 steps.
- `x = 1`: You pass `1` as the input.
- Steps:
  - `i = 0`: `add1(1) = 2`
  - `i = 1`: `times2(2) = 4`
- Result: `4`
- **Why `x = 1`?**: The example picked `1` to demonstrate a small starting value growing through two steps.

#### Example 3: `do_all_functions(2)`

- Code: `do_all_functions = my_cycle(3); do_all_functions(2)`
- `n = 3`: Apply 3 steps.
- `x = 2`: You pass `2` as the input.
- Steps:
  - `i = 0`: `add1(2) = 3`
  - `i = 1`: `times2(3) = 6`
  - `i = 2`: `add3(6) = 9`
- Result: `9`
- **Why `x = 2`?**: They chose `2` to show all three functions in action with a different starting point.

#### Example 4: `do_more_than_a_cycle(2)`

- Code: `do_more_than_a_cycle = my_cycle(4); do_more_than_a_cycle(2)`
- `n = 4`: Apply 4 steps.
- `x = 2`: You pass `2` again.
- Steps:
  - `i = 0`: `add1(2) = 3`
  - `i = 1`: `times2(3) = 6`
  - `i = 2`: `add3(6) = 9`
  - `i = 3`: `add1(9) = 10`
- Result: `10`
- **Why `x = 2` again?**: Reusing `2` shows how more steps (`n = 4` vs. `n = 3`) change the outcome.

#### Example 5: `do_two_cycles(1)`

- Code: `do_two_cycles = my_cycle(6); do_two_cycles(1)`
- `n = 6`: Apply 6 steps (two full cycles).
- `x = 1`: You pass `1`.
- Steps:
  - `i = 0`: `add1(1) = 2`
  - `i = 1`: `times2(2) = 4`
  - `i = 2`: `add3(4) = 7`
  - `i = 3`: `add1(7) = 8`
  - `i = 4`: `times2(8) = 16`
  - `i = 5`: `add3(16) = 19`
- Result: `19`
- **Why `x = 1`?**: Back to `1` to contrast with earlier examples and show a full double cycle.

### Why the Difference in `x`?

The starting `x` changes because:

1. **It’s Up to You**: When you call `my_cycle(n)(x)`, you pick `x`. The examples use `5`, `1`, or `2` to test different scenarios.
2. **Show Variety**: The docstring wants to demonstrate how `cycle` works with different inputs and `n` values, so it mixes up `x` to keep things interesting and clear.
   - `x = 5` with `n = 0`: Shows “do nothing.”
   - `x = 1` with `n = 2`: Shows two steps.
   - `x = 2` with `n = 3`: Shows a full cycle.
   - `x = 1` with `n = 6`: Shows two cycles.

There’s no rule saying `x` must be `1` or `2`—it’s just the input you provide!

---

### How Can `x` Change the Result?

The starting `x` is like the seed you plant. The same `n` with a different `x` gives a different “tree”:

- `my_cycle(3)(2)`:
  - `2 → 3 → 6 → 9` (result: `9`).
- `my_cycle(3)(1)`:
  - `1 → 2 → 4 → 7` (result: `7`).
- Same steps (`add1, times2, add3`), different starting points.

---

### Simple Answer

- **Why does `x` start at `1` sometimes and `2` other times?**: It’s just the input chosen for each example. You decide `x` when you call the function, like `my_cycle(3)(2)` or `my_cycle(6)(1)`.
- **How can it vary?**: Because `x` is the starting value you pass, and `cycle` applies the functions to whatever `x` you give it.

Try it yourself with `my_cycle(3)(5)` or `my_cycle(2)(10)`—`x` can be anything, and the cycle will roll from there!

# discussion 1

Let's break this down step by step:

### Given code:

```python
result = (lambda x: 2 * (lambda x: 3)(4) * x)(5)
```

### Step 1: Identify inner lambda function

The expression inside the outer lambda function is:

```python
(lambda x: 3)(4)
```

- This is an **immediately invoked lambda function**, meaning it is executed right away.
- The function `(lambda x: 3)` takes an argument `x` but **ignores** it and always returns `3`.
- When we pass `4` to it:
  ```python
  (lambda x: 3)(4)  →  3
  ```

### Step 2: Replace the inner lambda function result

Now, replace `(lambda x: 3)(4)` with `3` in the outer lambda function:

```python
(lambda x: 2 * 3 * x)(5)
```

This simplifies to:

```python
(lambda x: 6 * x)(5)
```

### Step 3: Evaluate the outer lambda function

Now, call the outer lambda function with `x = 5`:

```python
6 * 5  = 30
```

### Final Result:

```python
result = 30
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Lambda functions** can be called immediately when defined.
2. **Inner lambda function execution happens first** and its result replaces the expression.
3. **Variable shadowing** happens when an inner lambda function has a parameter with the same name as an outer one (but it doesn’t affect the outer scope).
4. **Order of operations matters**—always evaluate the innermost expressions first.

Would you like another example to reinforce this?

a function that is gonna print if the case it true

```python

def make_keeper(n):
    def f(cond):
        i = 1
        while i <= n:
            if cond(i):
                print(i)
            i += 1
    return f
keep_even = make_keeper(5)
keep_even(lambda x: x % 2 == 0) # Prints 2, 4

```

Here's a simplified version of the lambda function in `find_digit`:

```python
return lambda x: (x // (10 ** (k - 1))) % 10
```

### Explanation:

1. `10 ** (k - 1)`:

   - This calculates \(10^{(k-1)}\), which shifts the desired digit to the last position.
   - Example: If `k = 2`, then `10 ** (2 - 1) = 10`, so `x // 10` removes the last digit.

2. `x // (10 ** (k - 1))`:

   - This removes the last `(k-1)` digits, bringing the `k`th digit to the rightmost place.
   - Example: `3456 // 10 = 345`, `345 // 10 = 34`, `34 % 10 = 4` (2nd digit from right).

3. `% 10`:
   - Extracts the last digit (which is now the desired digit).

### Example Walkthrough:

For `find_digit(2)(3456)`:

- `k = 2`, so we compute:  
  \[
  (3456 // 10) \% 10 = 345 \% 10 = 5
  \]
- The output is `5`, which is the 2nd digit from the right.

This lambda function efficiently extracts the `k`th digit from the right in one step. 🚀

- number // 10^k-1 -> get how many digit u want 😉

- % 10 -> get only the last digit 😉

### Explanation of the `race` Function

The `race` function simulates a race between a **tortoise** and a **hare** and determines how many minutes pass before the tortoise catches up to the hare.

#### **Understanding the Movement**

- The **tortoise** moves at a constant speed of `x` feet per minute.
- The **hare** runs at `y` feet per minute but follows a cycle:
  - Runs for **5 minutes**
  - Then **rests for 5 minutes** (does not move)

The function finds the **first time when the tortoise catches up to the hare**.

---

### **Key Points in the Code**

1. **Assertion: Ensuring the hare is fast but not too fast**

   ```python
   assert y > x and y <= 2 * x, 'the hare must be fast but not too fast'
   ```

   - The hare must be **faster than the tortoise** (`y > x`).
   - The hare must not be **too fast** (`y <= 2 * x`) to ensure the tortoise has a chance to catch up.

2. **Initialize variables**

   ```python
   tortoise, hare, minutes = 0, 0, 0
   ```

   - Both the tortoise and hare start at position `0`.
   - `minutes` tracks the time elapsed.

3. **Race Simulation Loop**

   ```python
   while minutes == 0 or tortoise - hare:
   ```

   - The loop continues **until the tortoise catches up** (when `tortoise == hare`).
   - `minutes == 0` ensures the loop runs at least once.

4. **Move the tortoise**

   ```python
   tortoise += x
   ```

   - The tortoise **always** moves `x` feet per minute.

5. **Move the hare if not resting**

   ```python
   if minutes % 10 < 5:
       hare += y
   ```

   - The hare **runs for the first 5 minutes** of every 10-minute cycle.
   - `minutes % 10 < 5` checks whether the hare is in the running phase.

6. **Increment time**

   ```python
   minutes += 1
   ```

   - Each loop iteration represents **one minute** passing.

7. **Return the total minutes elapsed**
   ```python
   return minutes
   ```
   - When the tortoise catches up, the function stops and returns the time.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Case: `race(5, 7)`**

- **Tortoise speed** = 5 feet/min
- **Hare speed** = 7 feet/min (for 5 minutes, then rests for 5 minutes)

| Minute | Tortoise | Hare | Hare Running?   |
| ------ | -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| 1      | 5        | 7    | ✅              |
| 2      | 10       | 14   | ✅              |
| 3      | 15       | 21   | ✅              |
| 4      | 20       | 28   | ✅              |
| 5      | 25       | 35   | ✅              |
| 6      | 30       | 35   | ❌              |
| 7      | 35       | 35   | ❌ (Caught up!) |

**Result: `race(5, 7) → 7 minutes`**

---

### **Simplified Key Takeaways**

- The **tortoise moves steadily** every minute.
- The **hare runs for 5 minutes**, then **rests for 5 minutes**.
- The loop **stops when the tortoise catches up** to the hare.
- The `minutes % 10 < 5` check ensures the hare follows its running/resting cycle.
- **Returns the time taken for the tortoise to catch up.**

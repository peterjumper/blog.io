Full- Duplex
UTP Cables(10base-t),100base-t
So remember this, Routers transmit data on pins 1 and 2, and receive data on pins 3 and 4

Once again, switches are the opposite-
due to oppisite transfer style , it woks

receive data nnlninq 1 and 2 and transmit = 3 and 6

straight-through cable
1 -> 2 
2 -> 1
3 -> 3

router to router -> don't work 1 -> 1 due to same traansfer style

switch to switch -> don't work as well

- UTP cables (10base-t,100 base-t)

Crossover cable, solve this problem
1 -> 3
2 -> 6 
3 -> 1
6 -> 2

Table:
Device Type Transmit (TX) Pins | Receive (RX) Pins

Router  1 and 2 3 and 6
Firewall 1 and 2 3 and 6
PC       1 and 2 3 and &
Switch  3 and 6 1 and 2  **only switch is different**

mordern -> **AUTO MDI-x** , auto deteck and adjust

- utp cables(1000base-t,10gbase-t)

    - each pair is bidirectional

SFP Transceiver

fiber-optic connections
Tx -> transmit
Rx -> Receive

the outer jacket of the cable(differnt breed)
- single-mode
    - allow longer cables than both utp 
- multimode
    - wider core diameter
    - cheaper 

table 


UTP cable VS Fiber-optic cable

- uTpP
Lower cost than fiber-optic.
Shorter maximum distance than
fiber-optic (~100m).

Can be vulnerable to EMI
(Eletromagnetic Interference).
RJ45 ports used with UTP are
cheaper than SFP ports.

Emit (leak) a faint signal outside
of the cable, which can be copied
(=security risk)

- Fiber-Optic
Higher cost than UTP.
Longer maximum distance than
UTP.
No vulnerability to EMI.
SFP ports are more expensive
than RJ4S ports (single-mode is
more expensive than multimode).
Does not emit any signal outside
of the cable (=no security risk).

optical fiber is actually cover longer distance than utp

single-mode is the longest
- cover 3 km 🐂

utp -> muitleple switch




# Layer 2

the minimum payload size for ethernet frame is 
46 bit

Ethernet Frame -> APR ICMP -> (Ping)

show mac adderss table 
clear mac address table address 
clear mac address table intrface 

ping

cisco need to enable root mode first

ping -> show the size 36

need 10 byte to fullfill the minimum
46-36=10
> padding byte to fullfill that

Padding : 10 bytes of padding 
hex -> 20 0 ,(two 0 of hex 0x0 =1 bytes) -> 20/2 = 10 bytes

wireshark -> 

Type -> (0x0800)  IPvl 4
Type0x86dd -> IPv6

e.g. -> APR(0x0806) -> inside the frame 

ARP ( address resolution protocol)
- ARP request (broadcast all hosts on the LAN ( local network))
- arp reply

ARP table
- ping
    - ICMP echo request
    - ICMP echo Reply
- MAC address Table

show mac address-table cisco show what ?
**vlan | mac address | type | ports**

arp -a 🗝️

**internet | physical address|type**

- which types of frames does a switch send out of all iterfaces, except the one the frame was received on?
    - Broadcast, unkown unicast
    FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
    only unknown unicast require broadcast


How to clear all dynamic Mac addresses ?
**clear mac address-table dynamic**

Clear all entries for a specific dynamic MAC address from the MAC Address Table:
- clear mac address-table dynamic address mac-address


what is the ethernet type code for an ARP packet?
- 0x0806

What is the minimum size of an Ethernet frame? (Header + Payload + Trailer)
64 bytes

- minimum size of an Ethernet payload/packet => 64 bytes – 18 bytes (header + trailer size) = 46 bytes 

Command to show the arp table on a cisco deice

- show arp
